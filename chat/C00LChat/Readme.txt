			Cool Ch@t
		     By Amey Chaugule

	Hey guy's u r reading the worst readme in the world cauz i can't write decent one myself. This program was made using VB 6.0 Enterprise edition. This program can be used only by two ppl in a Chatroom. Mail me all the bugs at : ameychaugule@eth.net

1. How to use this program

	One preson has to be a host and other one has to be a joiner. Joiner has to connect to the IP of host. You can run this program on same computer also. Run 2 copies simultaneously. Make a Chatroom from one. Then Join the Chat room from Other( on Internet or Local IP).
